## Overview
​
### The challenge

Using an API call to make a Weather App.
​
### User Story
​
We call an API for the user to be able to search for cities, view history of previous searches and a five day future forecast.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
-user should be able to search for any city
-search history should pull up
-5 day weather forecast should show


## My process
I first started with the HTML and CSS to build a backbone of what the app would look like. Then I did API calls for the weather app and tied in classes and id with document queries and event selectors to display information tot he app.
​
### Built with
​
- HTML
- CSS
-javascript
-api calls
​

​
### What I learned
​
For this challenge I learned a bit more about third party apis and how there are so many limitless possibilities with third party apis. One thing that really stood out to me ws that, even though a lot of these apis give you a base api framework to work with and to expand upon, there's also things to consider such as limits to API calls and the code not working sometimes.
​
### Continued development
​
TO continue development, I would like to add more functions and buttons, for example to be able to compare weathers for different cities.
​

### Useful resources
Openweather one call api to get the api
